# Course-Documentation-

First, I would like to thank God for this opportunity and privilege to have been able to 

come this close to becoming a developer.

I would also want to appreciate Mr. Ajah for his guidance, especially the last interactive 

session we had – Thank you.

It has always been a deliberation for me whenever it had to do with coding or stressing 

my brain and wondering why a code didn’t work, just to realise that I hadn’t put a 

semicolon at the end of the line of code.

Well, I would say I learnt to find a way around to deal with stress – Just Maybe.

But this Journey to learn a Skill and at that, in consistency, isn’t what I thought would be 

easy, except God helps me, and He does – He did.

I got introduced to a Website by my Mr. Ajah, that offers a huge load of courses – which 

much led to the decision of choosing the Front-End Web development Course. 

Was this my first interest? No.

Funny enough, I went for the Full Stack Web development Course. I thought I had at 

least, reached a level where I could take this one. 

I mean why wouldn’t I able to go all in? A little further into the course, gave an urgent 

signal of my lack of knowledge and incompetency about the spoken terms and 

subjects. I mean I tried to keep up, but most times, instead of the rush, go step by step.

And that’s what I did. 

I finally chose the course that will take me one step at a time to reaching my goal.

I’ve always been fascinated about design, build something. Or should I say I developed 

this interest due to series of exposures to different varieties of Interest. 

Before I started this course I had at least a fundamental knowledge about CSS, HTML 

and JavaScript, mostly gotten from watching videos on YouTube. Rated on a scale of 1 – 10 of how much I knew, JavaScript was probably at a scale of 0.5

So, here’s my journey so far, the feelings and encounters I had, as I learnt and 

progressed through every stage of the course.

#My Thoughts and Experiences 

One of the terms that stuck with me throughout the HTML and CSS part-project, was 

the possibility to be able to create very good responsive web designs if there was an 

understanding attached on how to implement the DOM system. DOM, meaning, 

Document Object Model is a parsed representation of the attributes in the HTML.

The need for implementation, design Systems and structuring, formed the basis.

Well, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen this kind of structure, but as learnt the 

relationships and how each element in the HTML document relates to each other, I 

gained clarity.

The need for a <head> was to create a relationship between the parent and its children.

The <head> and the <body> are all children to the <html> when it comes to its 

structure. 

Here’s the fun part. 

It would be impossible to link between pages or documents without putting down the fundamental tag element. The <link>, as I understood, serves as a gateway or maybe gate that helps, give the HTML document, access to every other document available in a created folder or file. To do this, the links are either imported or linked directly in the HTML document. By import, the target CSS file is first, linked to the HTML document 
depending on directories. Then the related CSS files needed for a project are imported to the already linked target CSS file. This gives the HTML document access to both the target file, and other related files, depending on directories.


Learning Structures and Mind maps through a project has become for me, a very essential tool to building up Websites.

I often wondered how the elements available in a page can be manipulated and implemented based on desired motive. It will be obvious that there are limitations available, but that’s if the fundamental rules of application aren’t applied, or even considered.

Take for instance. The Layout and Content structure of a Page. This is in relation to the combination of Grids and Flexbox to structure a page. 

To be able to access the underlying features and attributes available in the Flexbox, a certain rule must be applied. I mean, I had seen this being coded so many times, but it was only until now that I really understood. 

Setting the display of a document, to flex, makes it possible to access properties in the Flexbox, like the flex-direction, justify-content, align-items. 

I tried using the attributes without first applying the fundamental principle, and it didn’t work. I think the best way to learn something is to break it, then fix it. I am able to recall 

every process, because I was inquisitive. I wanted to know why something worked, and what would happen if I gave a different input.

I got to learn that if Flexbox was for the content structure, then Grids are for the Layout of the entire page. It just like setting up the external walls of a building during 

construction to determine the flow of every other element in the building like the space orientation and partitions. 

Grids helps to determine the design direction of a page. In direct combination with the Flexbox, helps to create very responsive webpages and provides a structured flow throughout the project

I’ve always loved arranging and putting things in order, so when a chance is presented 

that helps minimize constraints, I would rather go for that.

I got to understand that everything that happens on a live website, aren’t by 

coincidence. There are plans, methods, set in place that helps achieve the desired 

outcome for a website, including its functionality.

And that’s where JavaScript comes in.

I’m still fresh into this part, but what I’ve got to understand, is also the relationship 

between the DOM and ways to gain access into it. 

It’s amazing how far I’ve had to come, and I believe it only gets better.
